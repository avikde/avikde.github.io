![Avik De](/images/Avik-De.jpg)

I'm a co-founder and CTO of [Ghost Robotics](https://www.ghostrobotics.io/) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG4Xp4nghgyWK4ud5Xbo-4g), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ghost_Robotics)), a startup company commercializing legged robotics in Philadelphia. The company currently has two products, a 45kg quadruped aimed at industrial applications, and a 12kg quadruped aimed at research applications. 

Previously, I completed a postdoc at [Harvard's microrobotics lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/) advised by Rob Wood, where I researched design of micro-scale flapping robots, as well as strategies for their control. 

I received my PhD in Sep 2017, at the GRASP laboratory ([Kodlab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/)) in the University of Pennsylvania advised by Dan Koditschek. 

The main thread tying all of my work has been bio-inspired design and control strongly anchored in empirical robotics. My research has focused on examining the strengths and weaknesses of modular and hierarchical control strategies, as well as demonstrating efficient and effective control of dynamic locomotion in a way that generalizes across platforms (quadruped, tailed biped, ‚Ä¶) and behaviors (hopping, running, ‚Ä¶).

## ‚öΩ Hobbies

It is pretty tough to keep up with all my hobbies, but I'm doing my best.

Some of my favorite hobbies have been ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering kittens](/tags/#cats) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/).

I used to have pretty good (musical) keyboard chops (as much as you can without any formal music theory) and still have great [relative pitch](http://www.perfectpitch.com/perfectrelative.htm).

I used to be decent at juggling (basic 3-ball patterns up to Mill's mess, 4-ball cascade on a good day).

I am drawn to [games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) that [require](http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled-blitz) rapid [pattern-matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)), and enjoy [casual art](/tags/#art).

<!-- ### üß≥ Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved. Also see [all the posts on travel](/tags#travel).
