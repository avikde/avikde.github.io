title: Power-efficient autonomous mobile robots talk
categories: talk
---

I gave a [talk at OSU's CoRIS seminar](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/events/power-efficient-autonomous-mobile-robots). It was a joy to visit OSU's Robotics department. The faculty are driven to solve problems grounded in the real world, in application areas ranging from under the sea to the peak of Mt. Hood.

Also, it was only partially raining on the day of the seminar (which I found out was a rarity). The [PNW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) scenery is terrific and would be a great draw if it didn't mostly rain from September to May.

## Modularity

In this talk, I started with my own intellectual interests in robotics, which was very much a bottom-up exploration of composition in robotics.

### Dynamic legged locomotion

As with I'm sure many others, as a young graduate student, I was inspired by the dynamic legged locomotion work at the MIT Leg Lab in the 1980's:

In his thought-provoking [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262681193/legged-robots-that-balance/), [Marc Raibert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Raibert) articulated an intriguing idea called "Control of Running Decomposed into Three Parts." Researchers have been trying to understand when and how this may be possible, and how it generalizes, since then.

My Ph.D. advisor, [Dan Koditschek](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/daniel-e-koditschek/), has been doing that for decades. In the 1990's, his research group built and impressive array of juggling robots (as a less-power-hungry proxy for cyclic dynamical behavior):

In the course of the juggling research, they introduced a formal idea of [sequential composition](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67990/10.1177_02783649922066385.pdf) with an intuitive but mathematically rigorous and useful idea:

Analogously, we can retroactively label Raibert's "control in three parts" idea as an example of [parallel composition](/jerboa-hopping-video). While the term is not extremely common in the robotics literature, similar concepts appear with names such as "decoupled control". The idea has clearly been empirically useful, but [formalizing it](/hybrid-averaging) has been quite tricky with any degree of generality.

Sequential and parallel composition are a very intuitive idea with equivalents in programming and spoken language. Consider the example of generating spoken language -- instead of outputting the sounds corresponding to an entire sentence at once, we may want to start by assembling words from [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme), and assembling those into sentences. On the other hand, modern [deep learning speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_speech_synthesis) may not have any such compositional properties, which is an intentional counterpoint that we will return to.

### Modularity elsewhere

_TO BE COMPLETED_

Deep learning did evolve from neural networks, which evoke biology right there in the name. Research in robotic locomotion has also similarly looked to biology for inspiration.

Stepping back, eq can make some equivalences

Why do we need it?

* Address fundamental robotics constraints in power, force, and computation

How do we get it?

* Principled application of reduced-order models for design and control

, then moved to the motivation from real-world applications with Ghost Robotics
