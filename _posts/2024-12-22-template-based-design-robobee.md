title: Template-based design for RoboBee (IROS 2020)
categories: papers robobee

While there have been numerous projects where I've utilized reduced-order models for control, this is the first published one where I've been able to use them for optimizing robot design. It is also applied to a fairly complex system, the [RoboBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboBee), justifying the effort expended into developing numerical methods for design.
