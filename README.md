# My website

## Building the website locally

- From admin command prompt: `choco install jekyll` -- this failed with an error installing jekyll but did seem to install its dependencies
- Close and open another admin command prompt: `gem install github-pages wdm webrick`
- Open a regular command prompt, and type `jekyll -v` to check that it worked.
- In project dir: `jekyll serve`
